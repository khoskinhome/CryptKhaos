This module holds the symbolic names for the permitted characters,
and the characters they map to.

i.e. exclamation_mark is the symbolic name for a !

Also note that the char_set's both the predefined ones in Crypt::Khaos::Conf::CharSetDefaults
and user-defined ones that end up in (most likely) $ENV{HOME}/.cryptkhaos/conf/
and the hard-coded user examples that get dumped out in Crypt::Khaos::Conf::ExampleDumps;
must ONLY define the characters that are listed here.

They don't have to define ALL of them, but they must only define the ones
defined here.

i.e. they can be the exact same set of these characters or a subset of these characters.

The above char_sets will be sanity checked against the characters defined here.
